  L O G

  This was supposed to be a JSON file, but I'm having trouble implementing it. The log entry names are dates and times in hexadecimal form to reduce file size.

  s = start time
  e = end time
  c = category
  t = title
  d = description

  COD = coding
  VIS = graphics
  AUD = music
  ACA = academics
  RES = research
  MNT = maintenance
  LEI = leisure
  DIY = DIY projects
  ART = drawing, sketching, painting
